## Usage

Our app was designed to be simple to use with an easy UI.

To get started the user is presented with the home screen prompting the user to sign up or login in if they are not already. Users can then navigate home page to see and create posts and react to others. 

From the nav bar at the top the can then go to their profile which has a list of all their previous posts.

They can also travel to our about and contact pages to learn more about us and reach out to a developer.

The last option is loggin out.
